# Correlations-and-Differences-Between-Lesbians-and-Gay-Men-on-Reddit
I utilized pushshift API on one gay and one lesbian reddit page and compared the use of different words on each page using CountVectorizer (CVEC) and TfidfVectorizer (TVEC). I utilized Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Multinomial models with CVEC and TVEC through pipelines and gridsearch to find the best correlations.
